        "\n",
        "1.  **What makes people say \"yes\" or \"no\"?** We want to find out which things about a customer or the phone call itself make them more likely to agree to the bank's offer.\n",

        "* **Job**: What kind of jobs do our customers have? Are there more teachers, engineers, or something else?\n",
        "* **Marital Status**: Are most customers single, married, or divorced?\n",
        "* **Education**: What level of education do they have?\n",
        "* **Bank Balance**: What's the typical amount of money customers have in their bank accounts?\n",
        "* **Campaign Contacts**: How many times did we call each customer during this campaign?\n",
        "* **Call Duration**: How long did the last phone call last? (This one's tricky, see \"Things to Keep in Mind\"!)\n",
        "* **Previous Outcome**: Did our last marketing try with this customer succeed or fail?\n",

        "* **Bank Balance and Subscription**: Do richer customers say \"yes\" more often?\n",
        "* **Call Duration and Subscription**: Does a longer call mean a \"yes\"? (Again, tricky!)\n",
        "* **Previous Outcome and Subscription**: If they said \"yes\" or \"no\" before, does it affect their answer now?\n",
        "* **Economy and Subscription: Do things like unemployment rates or consumer confidence affect whether people subscribe?\n",

        "* **Old Data**: This data is from 2008-2010. What worked back then might not work exactly the same way today.\n",
        "* **The \"Call Duration\" Trick**: The `duration` of the last call is a super strong predictor of \"yes\" or \"no.\" But, you only know how long a call lasted *after* it's over! So, we can't use this to *predict* if someone will say \"yes\" *before* we call them. It's good for understanding, but not for predicting in real-time.\n",
        "* **Uneven Answers**: There might be many more \"no\" answers than \"yes\" answers. This means we'll need to be smart about how we teach a computer to predict.\n",
        "* **Missing Time Details**: We know the month and day of the week, but we don't have exact times or a detailed history of calls for each person.\n"
